Klea RAG
========

Klea RAG is Klea's retrieval-augmented generation component.  It applies
the general RAG ideas described in :doc:`../concepts/rag` as a
configurable, multi-domain pipeline: each query is classified, retrieved
from the matching domain's stores, answered from the retrieved context,
and evaluated.  This page describes how the pipeline works; for a hands-on
walkthrough see :doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag`.

Pipeline
--------

At a high level, a query flows through these stages:

1. **Guard** (optional) -- a safety model (e.g. ``llama-guard3``)
   checks whether the query is safe and appropriate.  Unsafe queries
   are declined immediately.  Set ``KLEA_RAG_GUARD_MODEL`` to an empty
   value to skip this step entirely.

2. **Classify** -- a chat model classifies the query into one of the
   configured *domains* (e.g. "NeuroML documentation"), or routes it
   to general chat, or refuses if no domain matches.

3. **Retrieval** -- the system generates one or more search queries,
   optionally calls MCP tools (for live data), and retrieves the most
   relevant chunks from the matching domain's stores (vector stores
   and/or BM25 keyword stores).  Results from the different stores are
   combined with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (see :ref:`hybrid-retrieval`).

4. **Answer** -- the chat model generates an answer from the
   retrieved context, citing its sources.

5. **Evaluate** -- an evaluator checks the answer's quality.  If it
   is unsatisfactory, the system can loop back to retrieve more
   information, rewrite the query, or regenerate the answer.

6. **Memory** -- conversation history is summarised per session so
   the system can refer to earlier exchanges.

The pipeline is implemented as a `LangGraph
<https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ state machine, using
the shared :class:`~klea_utils.graph.base.BaseLangGraph`
orchestrator from ``klea_utils``.

Domains and stores
------------------

Domains are the organising unit of Klea RAG:

* A **domain** bundles related knowledge and configuration
  (e.g. "NeuroML documentation", "My project's internal docs").
* Each domain has one or more **stores** containing the chunks:
  **vector stores** (dense embedding similarity) and/or **BM25 keyword
  stores** (classic lexical search).
* The classifier uses the domain's *description* to decide where a
  query should go.
* Domains can also have **MCP servers** attached, giving the LLM
  access to live tools (e.g. a validation server, a database query
  tool).

Each store's ``name`` in the config must exactly match the
``--collection`` name used when the store was created with
``klea-stores-create``, and its ``path`` must match the location the
chunks were written to.  Retrieval looks stores up by name, so a
mismatch silently returns no results.  For local Chroma stores the
``path`` points at the store folder; the database file inside it is
always named ``chroma.sqlite3`` (see
:doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag`).  Chroma collections created by
``klea-stores-create`` use **cosine** HNSW distance, so the vector-store
relevance score is a cosine similarity (and the retrieval
``score_threshold`` reads as a minimum cosine similarity).

This means one RAG server can simultaneously serve completely
different knowledge areas -- the classifier routes queries to the
right domain automatically.

.. _filter-fields:

Domain filter fields
--------------------

Domains can declare **retrieval filter fields** with ``filter_fields``:
a list of ``{name, description, value_type}`` entries.  These are the
only metadata fields the retrieval query generator may constrain on --
the generator's prompt lists exactly the fields the domain declares, so
it never proposes a filter on a metadata key that does not exist.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "repository_type",
     "description": "hosting type: github, dandi, biomodels or figshare",
     "value_type": "string"
   },
   {
     "name": "tags",
     "description": "repository tags",
     "value_type": "list"
   }

``value_type`` controls how a bare constraint is matched:

* ``string`` / ``int`` / ``float`` -- exact equality; a list of values
  becomes ``$in`` (any-of), and numeric fields also accept a range
  written as an operator expression (e.g. ``{"$gte": 2020,
  "$lte": 2025}``).
* ``list`` -- element membership (``$contains``): the metadata list must
  contain the stated value, and several values require *every* one to be
  present.

The ``description`` is shown to the retrieval query generator so it
knows when and how to populate each field.

Filters are **domain-scoped**: the whole domain (all of its stores)
shares one declared set.  This matches the expectation that the stores
of a domain are built from the same corpus -- and therefore carry the
same metadata keys.  When a query is routed to several domains, each
domain only receives the filter clauses on the fields it declares, so a
papers domain never has a repository filter applied to it (and vice
versa).

Some practical notes:

* **Person-name fields** (e.g. ``authors`` on a papers domain) match
  partial names: stored author names are expanded with per-word variants
  at store time, so "Sinha" matches an author stored as "Ankur Sinha"
  (see :ref:`metadata-extraction`).
* A domain that declares no ``filter_fields`` gets unfiltered retrieval
  -- queries are matched purely by semantic and lexical search.  This is
  the right default for general documentation.
* A declared field only *works* on stores that actually store that
  metadata key; retrieval on a store missing the key yields nothing from
  that store for that constraint.

.. _hybrid-retrieval:

Hybrid retrieval (vector + BM25)
--------------------------------

Each domain can configure ``vector_stores``, ``bm25_stores``, both, or
neither.  BM25 provides a classic keyword search that complements
dense embedding similarity: exact names, symbols, and terminology that
a semantic search might miss are surfaced by the lexical match.

When a domain configures both, every query runs against all of the
domain's stores and the results are combined with **Reciprocal Rank
Fusion** (RRF): a document is scored by its rank within each store's
result list (``1 / (60 + rank)``), so results from the different stores
are merged without comparing their raw scores (cosine similarity and
BM25 scores are not on the same scale).  Duplicate chunks are removed
and the top ``k`` references are kept.

The original per-source scores are preserved in each document's
``_source_scores`` metadata for debugging and introspection, but they are
not shown to the answer LLM.

These per-source scores are informational context, not a comparable
ranking.  The vector-store score is a cosine similarity in ``[0, 1]``
(1 = most similar to the query), while the BM25 score is a raw keyword
relevance value on an unbounded scale (higher = more matching terms).
The two are on different scales, so a BM25 value of e.g. ``5.1`` does
not mean the chunk is "better" than one with a vector-store score of
``0.68``.  Documents are ordered by the RRF rank fusion above, never by
comparing these raw values.

After fusion, the RRF ranking is given a small recency bias
(``rerank_by_recency``): the pure RRF score is normalized to ``[0, 1]``
and blended ``0.9 * relevance + 0.1 * time``, where the time term is
``(year - year_min) / (year_max - year_min)`` across the retrieved set
(relative to the newest and oldest document retrieved).  Documents
without a usable ``year`` get a neutral ``0.5`` time score.  Because
academic work builds on -- and often corrects -- earlier results, a
newer document outranks an older one of equal relevance, while relevance
still dominates the final ordering.

To create a BM25 store alongside a vector store, pass
``--bm25-store`` to ``klea-stores-create`` (see
:doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag`), then add a ``bm25_stores``
entry to the domain config pointing at the written corpus file.

After storing, ``klea-stores-create store-lint <corpus.pkl>`` reviews the
corpus with deterministic, LLM-free checks: a summary (chunks, files,
chunks-per-file, total characters), suspicious chunks (near-empty text
from a conversion/OCR miss, or missing bibliographic metadata), and
structural problems (chunks without a ``file_name``, invalid types).  It
also prints ``--samples`` evenly-spaced windows of contiguous chunks so
you can eyeball that chunking and metadata look right.  It is printed
automatically at the end of ``store`` when a BM25 corpus is written.

.. _reference-material:

Reference material for the answer LLM
-------------------------------------

The fused retrieval results are handed to the answer LLM as
*reference material*, grouped by source file.  Each file's shared
bibliographic metadata (authors, year, journal, DOI) is shown once on a
"source document" header, and the file's chunks are listed underneath,
numbered within the file.  Chunk-level metadata that differs from the
file's (e.g. a heading-specific URL) stays inline on the chunk.

The documents appear in the blended priority order (relevance, with
recency as a tiebreaker) described above.  Relevance scores are not
included in the reference material -- the LLM relies on the given order,
not numeric values.  Files are ordered by their best chunk's score, and
chunks within a file by score.  The exact serialized layout is described
in the :class:`~klea_utils.stores.utils.serialize_reference_material`
API reference.

.. _metadata-extraction:

Bibliographic metadata extraction
---------------------------------

When documents are chunked, Klea automatically tries to populate the
per-file ``DEFAULT`` entry of ``metadata-map.template.json`` (written to
the source directory's ``.klea-cache/``) with bibliographic metadata
(title, authors, keywords, DOI, URL).  This is a pre-population aid: the
researcher copies the template out, reviews and corrects the values
before storing, rather than filling the metadata map in from scratch.

Multiple URLs are written as separate keys (``url_1``, ``url_2``, ...);
each ``url*`` key is shown as its own reference in retrieval results and
passed to the answer LLM.  A non-numeric key suffix becomes its display
label: rename ``url_1`` to ``url_orcid`` in the template and the
reference panel shows ``orcid: <url>``.  When a DOI is found, the
``DEFAULT`` entry also gets a ``url_doi`` key derived from it
(``https://doi.org/<doi>``).

The extraction runs a tiered cascade, most authoritative first; each
tier only fills fields the tiers above it have not already set:

* ``doi-service`` -- a DOI discovered anywhere in the document is
  resolved via Crossref, OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar.  The three APIs
  are queried in round-robin order to spread load, falling back to the
  others when one is rate-limited, and results are cached to disk so
  re-ingests never re-query.  The resolved record's title, authors,
  year, journal and DOI override everything below.
* ``pdf-info`` -- the PDF Info dict (title, authors, keywords), read
  with pypdfium2.  Often empty: many publishers ship no bibliographic
  fields in the PDF.
* ``docling`` -- the free structured signals from Docling's layout
  model: the title item, the origin mimetype/URI, and the hyperlinks on
  text items.
* ``layout-regex`` -- regex over the focused first-page header region
  (the top fraction of page one, selected via the layout bounding
  boxes).
* ``regex`` -- regex over the first ~3000 characters of the document.

Two internal keys are added to each file's ``DEFAULT`` entry:

* ``_metadata_complete`` -- ``True`` only when a full DOI record (title
  + authors + year) or a full PDF Info dict (title + author + keywords)
  was obtained; ``False`` means the researcher should review the entry.
* ``_sources`` -- the tiers that contributed at least one field, in
  precedence order (e.g. ``["doi-service", "regex"]``).

These keys are internal: they guide the researcher reviewing the
template, and are never shown to the answer LLM.

When storing, each file's ``DEFAULT`` metadata is applied to every chunk,
and per-heading entries are merged over it.  For a chunk, the metadata
map is matched from the most specific to the least specific entry: the
full heading chain (e.g. ``"Chapter 1 > 2.1 Neurons"``) first, then
progressively shorter suffixes (``"2.1 Neurons"``), then progressively
shallower ancestor chains (``"Chapter 1"``).  The first non-empty
matching entry wins and is merged over ``DEFAULT`` (heading-specific keys
win, ``DEFAULT`` fills the rest).  This means a leaf section with no
metadata of its own inherits its nearest ancestor's -- so a section with
no ``url`` of its own is referred to the closest parent that has one.
An empty ``{}`` placeholder simply falls through to the next candidate,
and finally to ``DEFAULT``.  ``klea-stores-create map-lint <dir>`` runs
deterministic, LLM-free checks over the map (missing fields, suspicious
titles or DOIs, year/filename mismatches, stale ``venue`` keys, excess
``url*`` keys, and whether the top-level keys are the actual source
filenames) and is printed automatically after ``chunk``; re-run it
after hand-editing the template.  A source file with no map entry is
fatal (the ``store`` step would fail), so ``map-lint`` prints the full
report first and then exits non-zero; a map keyed by heading titles
instead of filenames is flagged as stale/heading-keyed.

DOI resolution uses the APIs' polite pool when ``KLEA_INGEST_MAILTO``
is set to an email address (higher rate limits).  It is skipped
entirely when no DOI is found in the document.  Optical character
recognition (OCR), which slows the conversion of text-based PDFs
considerably, can be disabled with ``klea-stores-create --no-ocr`` (see
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition>`_
for details).  Use ``klea-stores-create pre-check <dir>`` to classify
which PDFs actually need OCR (based on whether they carry an embedded
text layer) rather than guessing by publication year -- see
:doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag`.

Docling selects the inference accelerator automatically (CUDA, MPS, or
CPU), but GPUs with a CUDA capability below 7.0 (e.g. a Quadro P1000)
cannot run the Triton-compiled layout model.  Set the ``DOCLING_DEVICE``
environment variable to ``cpu`` in that case (optionally raising
``DOCLING_NUM_THREADS`` above the default of 4 to use more CPU cores);
see :doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag` for a worked example.

See :doc:`../api/utils/biblio` for the Python API and
:doc:`../guides/create-and-use-rag` for the ``chunk`` / ``store``
workflow.
